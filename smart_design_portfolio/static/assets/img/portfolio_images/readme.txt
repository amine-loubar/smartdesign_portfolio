remove the placeholder image and add your portfolio images in this folder and in the code where it says (../static/assets/img/portfolio_images/placeholder.png ), change the placeholder.png with your image name.
note:
- don't change the path before placeholder.png
- check the codec of the image (.png, .jpg, .svg, .jpeg.. etc) if you did the codec wrong the image won't show up.
